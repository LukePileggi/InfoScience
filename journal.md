# This is my journal for *Info Science*

1. What did we do?
- We tried to explain how to make a jelly sandwich so anybody could make one with no knowledge of making it.
2. What did you learn?
- I learned that it takes many steps to explain something. It is difficult, but is very interesting how we can clarify things with words.
3. What questions do you have?
- Is the ability of explaning things lower in our generation? Or is it just me?
